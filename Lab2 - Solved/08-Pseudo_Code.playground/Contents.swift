// Now that you know some of the basic building blocks using Swift
// It's time to try to Pseudo Code your Calculator Applicatoin!

// When app runs

// Main will retrieve the args user has typed in

// We'll process those args
    // Seperate those args into numbers and operators

    // Depending on opetator, we'll perform different operations

    // We'll store the value for each step

    // We'll loop through all nubmers, and perform all calculater, one step after another
